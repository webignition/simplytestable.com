    <p>
        The personal account is our entry level premium subscription for individuals
        at just &pound;{{ prices.personal }} per month.
    </p>

    <p>
        As with all accounts, your tests are private and can be accessed by you
        only. You can choose to share a read-only report with others.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an account holder you have access to all types of test offered: HTML
        validation, CSS validation, JavaScript static analysis and link integrity
        (broken link) checking.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a premium account holder, you can access your tests results forever
        and unlock the ability to test HTTPS sites, to test sites that use HTTP
        authentication and to use custom cookes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each test created under a personal acount will examine up to the first {{ features.test_limitations.pages_examined_per_test.value|number_format }}
        pages discovered. This gives a more broad insight over what can be acheived
        with a free account. A higher-tier premium account is required for testing larger sites.
    </p>

    <p>
        A personal account offers {{ features.test_limitations.credits_per_month.value|number_format }} credits per month. A single test against
        a single URL requires 1 credit. Higher-tier premium acounts offer
        greater credit allowances.
