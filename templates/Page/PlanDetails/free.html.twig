    <p>
        A free account costs nothing and keeps your tests as yours. Just sign in
        to ensure that all tests you run are tied to your account.
    </p>

    <p>
        The free account provides additional privacy and offers a wider breadth
        of use over the limited demo.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unlike the demo, you can test a given site or single page more any number
        of times as long as you have sufficient credits.

        A free account provides {{ plan.distinctions.test_limitations.credits_per_month }} credits per month. A single test against
        a single URL requires 1 credit.
    </p>

    <p>
        As with all accounts, your tests are private and can be accessed by you
        only. You can choose to share a read-only report with others.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pages to be tested will be discovered by examining a site's XML sitemap
        or news feed (RSS/Atom). If no pages are discovered, the site will
        be crawled to discover pages to test.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each test created under a free account will examine up to the first {{ plan.distinctions.test_limitations.pages_examined_per_test }}
        pages discovered. A premium account is required for testing larger sites.
    </p>

    <p>
        Tests created under your account are private. Results can be accessed
        only by you. You can choose to share a read-only report with others.
    </p>

    <p>
        Results can be viewed for up to
        {{ plan.distinctions.access_to_results.results_available_for }}. A premium account
        is required to view the results of older tests.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an account holder you have access to all types of test offered: HTML
        validation, CSS validation, JavaScript static analysis and link integrity
        (broken link) checking.
    </p>

    <p>
        Free account tests cannot be carried out against HTTPS sites,
        are not able to use HTTP authentication and are not able to set custom
        cookies. A premium account is required to use these features.
