    <p>
        A free demo is available to everyone - just visit the
        <a href="{{ web_client_urls.start_test }}">test dashboard</a>
        without signing in.
    </p>

    <p>
        The demo offers many of the features you would find if you had an account
        but is limited in the breadth of use.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can carry out 1 full-site test per site and 1 single-page test
        per page. This limit is not present if you create an account.
    </p>

    <p>
        All demo tests are public as standard. They can be viewed by anyone
        and are always to be found in the <a href="{{web_client_urls.history}}">demo account test history</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pages to be tested will be discovered by examining a site's XML sitemap
        or news feed (RSS/Atom).
    </p>

    <p>
        Sites with no sitemap or news need cannot be tested through the free demo.
        A free or premium account allows a site to be crawled to discover pages
        to test.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each full-site demo test will examine up to the first
        {{ plan.distinctions.test_limitations.pages_examined_per_test }}
        pages discovered. A premium account is required for testing larger sites.
    </p>

    <p>
        Results can be accessed for up to
        {{ plan.distinctions.access_to_results.results_available_for }}
        only. An account is required to claim and view older demo test results.
    </p>

    <p>
        Demo tests can carry out HTML validation and
        CSS validation tests. An account is required to carry out JavaScript
        static analysis and link integrity (broken
        link) checks.
    </p>

    <p>
        Demo tests cannot be carried out against HTTPS sites,
        are not able to use HTTP authentication and are not able to set custom
        cookies. A premium account is required to use these features.
    </p>
