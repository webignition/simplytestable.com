        The business account is our standard professional account for larger
        organisations at {{ plan.price|raw }} per month.
    </p>

    <p>
        As with all accounts, your tests are private and can be accessed by you
        only. You can choose to share a read-only report with others.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an account holder you have access to all types of test offered: HTML
        validation, CSS validation, JavaScript static analysis and link integrity
        (broken link) checking.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a premium account holder, you can access your tests results forever
        and unlock the ability to test HTTPS sites, to test sites that use HTTP
        authentication and to use custom cookies.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each test created under an business account will examine up to the first {{ plan.distinctions.test_limitations.pages_examined_per_test }}
        pages discovered.
    </p>

    <p>
        A business account offers {{ plan.distinctions.test_limitations.credits_per_month }} credits per month. A single test against
        a single URL requires 1 credit.
